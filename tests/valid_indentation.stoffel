# Basic indentation
let x = 10
if x > 5:
  let y = 20 # Indented block
  # Another comment inside
  y = y + 1
let z = 30 # Dedented back to original level

# Nested indentation
if x < 100:

  if a == 1:
    let b = 2 # Double indent
    b = b * x
  let c = 3 # Back to single indent level
let d = 4 # Back to top level

# Empty block (requires parser support, e.g., 'pass' keyword or allowing empty blocks)
# if x == 0:
#   pass # Placeholder for an empty block
