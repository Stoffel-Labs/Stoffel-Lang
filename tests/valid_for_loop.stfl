# Example program that should parse correctly

main main() -> nil:
  var total = 0

  # Iterate over a simple integer range
  for i in 0..4:
    if i < 2:
      var doubled = i + i
      discard doubled
    else:
      var tmp = i * 2
      discard tmp

  # Simple while loop to exercise loops and assignments
  while total < 10:
    total = total + 1
